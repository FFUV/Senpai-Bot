# Now Defunct
A hack.chat bot is a bot made for hack.chat that goes to different servers the commands on this bot will be shown when you do %help (special thanks to MrZhang365 for teaching me how to make bots)
This project just uses a few simple websocket-client protocols using a html library using requests !  ( btw if your wondering yes we did use jokeapi stay mad >:) )    [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/ttrmaniac/senpai-bot/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/ttrmaniac/senpai-bot)
